<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ About The Project

Throughout this project you¬¥ll find a developed webapp, with which you can interact to analyze and extract data insights about soccer, specifically club an player metrics such as goals, assists and points from match results.
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started

### Execute in the Web

To see and interact with the dashboard you can access through this [link](https://camiloms10-soccer-stats-dashboard-app-uisfh2.streamlitapp.com/).

### Prerequisites

These are the python libraries you¬¥ll need to run the install if you want to replicate this dashboard locally, I also suggest you read [Streamlit documentation](https://streamlit.io/) and install it properly.
* Libraries
  ```sh
  pip install streamlit
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install pandas
  pip install sklearn 
  pip install scipy
  pip install plotly
  pip install python-math
  pip install streamlit-option-menu
   ```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Data Sources

The data source of this project where downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Usage

You can use this dashboard to analyze:
* How a player has performed through time
* The correlation between individual statistics and player value
* Club performance (Goals For, Goals Against, Points) in 3 different views:
    * Home, Away and General
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Roadmap

To do ALL of the following web app developement I used *Streamlit*, you can find more about this tool [here](https://streamlit.io/). 

Now, to generate this multi-page app I followed this steps:

### 1. Creating the basic layout of the webpage

<p align ="center">
<a href="https://camiloms10-soccer-stats-dashboard-app-uisfh2.streamlitapp.com/">
<img src="images/layout_gif.gif">
</a>

* I¬¥ve included a home page in which you can get basic knowledge about what the web app has and how it is structured, this page also has a direct link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camilo-manzur-4b7137a8/?trk=public-profile-badge-profile-badge-view-profile-cta&originalSubdomain=mx) and you can also download my resume.
</p>

### 2. Exploring the data

<p align ="center">

* The main tables (csv files) used to generate the dashboard page are:
  * games.csv: 55,000+ games from many seasons on all major competitions
  * appearances.csv: 1,000,000+ player appearance records from all games


#### **Games table**
|game_id|competition_code|season|round                       |date      |home_club_id|away_club_id|home_club_goals|away_club_goals|

* Then we got secondary tables mainly to bring the names of competitions, clubs, player characteristics, etc.
</p>

#### **Leagues table**

<center>

| **league_id** | **name**             | **confederation** |
|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------:|
| L1            | bundesliga           | europa            |
| NL1           | eredivisie           | europa            |
| BE1           | jupiler-pro-league   | europa            |
| ES1           | laliga               | europa            |
| PO1           | liga-nos             | europa            |
| FR1           | ligue-1              | europa            |
| GB1           | premier-league       | europa            |
| RU1           | premier-liga         | europa            |
| UKR1          | premier-liga         | europa            |
| SC1           | scottish-premiership | europa            |
| IT1           | serie-a              | europa            |
| GR1           | super-league-1       | europa            |
| TR1           | super-lig            | europa            |
| DK1           | superligaen          | europa            |

</center>

Finally I created some complementary columns in each primary dataframe (games/appearances) such as:
  * Result/Winner = defined by  the home and away goals, the results for this column could be H(Home), A(Away) and D(Draw).
  * Home points = defined by the Result/Winner column, te results for this column could be 3,1 or 0. 
  * Away points = defined by the Result/Winner column, te results for this column could be 3,1 or 0.
  * G+A = defined by the sum of the goals and assists columns of the appearances dataframe.
  * G+A per 90 min = defined by the G+A column divided by the minutes played column, then multiplied by 90 in order to get the ratio.
</p>


### 3. Creating the dashboard tab

<p align ="center">
<img src="images/dashboard_layout.gif" >
</p>

First I defined the 2 main dataframes to interact with in a specific filter:
  1. Games dataframe: This dataframe will show the metrics in a Club level (Goals, Points).
  2. Appearances dataframe: This dataframe will show the metrics in a Player level (Goals, Assist, Value).

So for instance, if you select to view metrics in a Club level the filters will be a bit different from the Player level view, the Clubs be can be filter by Club and the Player view can be filtered by position. Both of the dataframes can be filtered by season and by league.

The filter work in different ways, I'll explain a bit more now:

  1. Season: Multiselection slider for any years the user wants to view (from 2013 to 2021).
  2. Competitions: Multiselection box to analyze multiple leagues at once (premier, laliga, etc.).
  3. Player positions: Multiselection box to analyze multiple positions at once (Attack, Midfield, etc.).
  4. Clubs: Multiselection box to analyze multiple clubs performance at once (from the competitions the user selected).

### 4. Creating the data extraction tab

<p align ="center">
<img src="images/data_extraction_layout.gif" >
</p>

The data extraction tool lets you obtain an extraction of the **games.csv** file as a new csv file for you to interact as you wish.

For this simple extraction tool I defined the main filters I wanted to include for anyone to filter this dataframe, the filters are the following:
* Season
* League
* Club

This extraction will let you know how any team performed in every game of a given season in their national league, the leagues and clubs filter let you select multiple choices at once.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Conclusions

- While developing this project I learned to use the Streamlit Python library to develop an interactive dashboard using other libraries (pandas, pyplot), this is a powerful tool as this can give any team the ability to interact with significant data with the filters they need (specific league, season, club, etc.) to obtain insights like trends, opportunities and defects.
